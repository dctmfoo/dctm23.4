    #     wsctf - wsctf plugin:  use java-free Content Transfer Framework plugin (CTF) without browser extensions
    #                                (Documentum Client Manager v2) for file upload and download.  This utilizes a
    #                                web socket connection between the web page and CTF instead of a browser extension.
    #
    # NOTE - CTF mode is DEPRECATED starting with the D2 16.7 release. It can still be used but is intended to
    #        be replaced by WSCTF mode. The details related to the CTF MODE can be read from the DEPRECATED_CTF_MODE
    #        section below.

    # The browser.plugin.mode setting below can be given one of the following values:
    #
    #     thin
    #     wsctf,thin
    #
    #     The behavior for each of these setting values is given in the table that follows below.

    #     Note that there are two fields in the D2 user settings UI pertaining to browser.plugin.mode:
    #
    #        - Update Browser Plugin combo box
    #             Choice list is given by mode(s) specified in the browser.plugin.mode setting value.

    # Support for clickjacking defense via Content-Security-Policy or X-Frame-Options response headers.
    # Content-Security-Policy is emitted for all browsers except IE, which does not understand this header.
    # X-Frame-Options is emitted only if the browser is IE.  The allowed.frame.origins setting is used
    # to control these response headers which in turn control whether another web page can load D2 into
    # a frame or iframe.
    #
    # If allowed.frame.origins is not set, then the emitted response header is:

    #   Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'
    #
    # for all browsers except IE and
    #
    #   X-Frame-Options: DENY

    # if the browser is IE.  In either case, this means that D2 cannot be loaded into any frame or iframe
    # on any web page.
    #
    # If allowed.frame.origins is set, then the possible values are 'none', 'self', or a space-separated
    # list of origins.  Note that the single-quote characters in 'none' and 'self' are required and that
    # any origin value in the list of origins can contain one or more '*' wildcard characters.
    #
    # If allowed.frame.origins has value 'none' or 'self', then the emitted response header is
    #
    #   Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'
    #   Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'

    # respectively for all browsers except IE and

    #   Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors <value of allowed.frame.origins>
    #
    # respectively for all browsers except IE.
    #
    # If the browser is IE, the X-Frame-Options response header is determined as follows:
    #
    # D2 first collects the origin values specified by the forOrigin query string parameter, the Referer
    # request header, and the Origin request header.  D2 then checks in this order whether any of these
    # origin values matches an allowed origin valued listed in allowed.frame.origins.  If a match is found,
    # then D2 emits the response header
    #
    #   X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM origin
    #
